Dunno what its gonna be yet but its gonna be something
## Where is the WIKI?
    The wiki is located on archbee.io. To request access please send a msg to
    tylerjgabb on github.



## What are our ideas? What kinds of things do we want to learn?
### Web apps, multiple containers
    Simple web apps with docker deployed within docker containers sending information 
    back and forth from seaparate machines (or same machine)

### Make a website for posting articles
    A standard blog posting website with users, comments, and posts
    as a full stack exercise

### Microservices and Databases
    We want to create an ecosystem of microservices that will allow us to learn about creating them, possibly putting them in containers, and learn about data management. Should each MS have its own DB? should there be one big MS that is used to share DB? The best practice is to have one microservice per containers


## What languages/tech will we use? What is our tech stack going to be like?
    We will prioritize using javascript and node. our database structure is yet undecided (i.e. nosql vs sql)
